# ## Trailers ##
#
# Trailers suitable for tracking and also for `git interpret-trailers`.
#
# Example of "See:" trailers that mean "see this additional information"
# and links to relevant web pages, issue trackers, blog posts, etc.:
#
#     See: https://example.com/
#     See: Issue #123 <https://example.com/issue/123>
#
# We like to use the "See:" trailers to link to issue trackers (e.g. Jira,
# Asana, Basecamp, Trello), document files and folders (e.g. Box, Dropbox),
# UI/UX designs (e.g. Figma, Lucidchart), reference pages (e.g. Wikipedia,
# internet RFCs, IEEE standards), and web posts (e.g. StackOverflow, HN).
#
# Example of "Co-authored-by:" trailers that list each author's name
# and their preferred commit message email address or contact URL:
#
#     Co-authored-by: Alice Adams <alice@example.com>
#     Co-authored-by: Bob Brown <https://bob.example.com>
#
# We like to use the "Co-authored-by:" trailers when we pair program,
# triple program, and group program. These are parsed automatically by
# some version control services (e.g. GitHub, GitLab) and will link
# to the authors' accounts and show up on the authors' commit history.
#
# The git tools require trailers to be last in a commit message,
# and must be one trailer per line, and with no extra lines between.
#
#
# ## Usage ##
#
# Put the template file here:
#
#     ~/.config/git/git-commit-template.txt
#
# Configure git to use the template file by running:
#
#     git config --global commit.template ~/.config/git/git-commit-template.txt
#
#
# ## Tracking ##
